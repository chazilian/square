## Steps to run the app
- Extract all the files from the zip file
- Open the project in android studio
- Build the project
- Run it in an Pixel 4(SDK 26) phone emulator

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
- Making sure the the viewmodel retains the data without it being lost on screen rotation
- For Malformed data in required fields to cause the list to not show up
- Prevent images from being reloaded

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
- Having the viewmodel retain the data throughout the lifecycle of a fragment
allows for apps to stop making uncessary calls to the database.
- When ingesting Malformed data it appears that the GSON Factory via Retrofit will allow for 
nulls to be ingested into non-nullable fields. In order to get arond this I had to create a 
custom function that will check for nulls in non-nullable fields
- Leveraged Glide's ability to cache images(set by default) as long as the URL is the same. 
It also allowed me to add a default image if an image failed to load.

## How long did you spend on this project?
- Around 4 hours to dev and implement all the features and another 2 hours to test it and 1 hour for the README

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
- Would have liked to have incorporated a navigation controller in the application, 
but since this is only 1 screen there was no purpose in it.
- Would like to have implememented another screen to show more details about the employee.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
- Probably testing, would have liked to use Mockito in some instances.

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
- I added the malformed list API endpoint, empty list API endpoint and normal list API endpoint to the API.
